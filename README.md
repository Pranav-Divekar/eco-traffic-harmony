# Smart Traffic Management System

An AI-powered traffic management system for reducing urban congestion and air pollution through intelligent traffic control.

## Project Overview

This Smart Traffic Management System harnesses cutting-edge IoT sensors, real-time data analytics, and adaptive Machine Learning (ML) techniques—including Reinforcement Learning (RL)—to optimize traffic signal timings. By analyzing both historical and live data, the system dynamically adjusts traffic flows, reduces vehicle idling, and minimizes fuel consumption and emissions.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Traffic Simulation**: Interactive visualization of traffic flow with AI-optimized signal control
- **Traffic Heatmap**: Visual representation of congestion across the urban area
- **Predictive Analytics**: LSTM-based forecasting of traffic conditions
- **Adaptive Traffic Control**: Reinforcement learning algorithms for dynamic signal optimization
- **System Monitoring**: Dashboard for tracking key performance indicators

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Custom SVG charts and simulations
- **AI Models**: Python implementation of LSTM and DQN reinforcement learning
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow

## System Architecture

The system is built on three core components:

1. **Data Collection & Processing Layer**: Gathers and normalizes traffic data from various sources
2. **AI Modeling Layer**: Applies machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize traffic patterns
3. **Control & Visualization Layer**: Provides interfaces for traffic operators and automated control systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ for the frontend application
- Python 3.8+ with TensorFlow 2.x for the ML models

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-traffic-management.git
cd smart-traffic-management

# Install frontend dependencies
